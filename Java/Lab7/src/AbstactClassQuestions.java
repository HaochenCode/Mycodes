    Answer the questions:
    1. Abstract classes are restricted classes that can't be used to create objects. Also, the abstract methods can't
       be implemented in the parent class, but must be implemented in subclasses. Abstract class can also have its own
       public methods, not just abstract methods.
    2. False, since abstract classes can have constructors. However, its constructor can only be called through
    constructor chaining, when creating objects from subclasses.
    3.Yes, abstract classes can also have other methods.
