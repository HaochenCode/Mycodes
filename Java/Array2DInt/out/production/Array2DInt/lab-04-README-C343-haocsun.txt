Part A:
    An ADT for a 2D Array of integers might specify the following operations:
      Set the 2D array by a given one.
      Return the array.
      Set every element to 0.
      Get a specific row as an array.
      Get a specific column.
      Replace a specific row or column.

    From this description, the input and output for each operation should be clear, but the implementation is not done.

Part B:
    I chose to use interface rather than abstract class, since abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract
    methods, but interfaces only accept abstract methods, which is exactly what I need for. Since I want to implement
    each method in my class.
